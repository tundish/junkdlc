        <h1>Flores and Winograd</h1>
<p>The Chilean Minister of Finance and a Stanford Professor of Artificial Intelligence walk into a bar.</p>
<p>They down a few Rum cocktails and recognize that they share an appreciation of Phenomenology.
So they raise their glasses to Hans-Georg Gadamer. They salute the hermeneutics of Martin Heidegger.
Then against a glorious Pacific sunset, the two men sling some horseshoes and conclude that there is no stable
representation of reality.</p>
<p>Language is action. Interpretation depends on what is present at hand.</p>
<p>Eventually they write a book called <em>Understanding Computers and Cognition</em>.
The copy I have is the third printing, from 1988. It's an excellent read, and much of it remains relevant to this
very day.</p>
<h1>Conversation for Action</h1>
<p>The fifth chapter of the book explores Language as protocol for shared Activity. It presents a state machine that describes the
conversation between two parties who are collaborating on a task of work.</p>
<p><img alt="JunkDLCPelican" src="https://tundish.github.io/junkdlc/img/UCAC_fig5-1.png" style="width:96%;margin:1rem"></p>
<p>The protagonists are labelled <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>.
The states are numbered. The terminal nodes are drawn slightly darker than the internal states of the diagram.</p>
<p>It begins with A making a request of B. B can reject it, promise to do it, or negotiate the terms of the request.</p>
<p>The action progresses as a conversation. Each transition is achieved by a piece of Speech.
The ideal outcome is to reach state 5, but there are various paths that terminate elsewhere.</p>
<h1>Modifications</h1>
<p>Now I've seen a lot of state diagrams in my time, but few so generally applicable as this one.</p>
<p>It appeals to me as a template for writing screenplay.
I think it might serve very well in constructing branching trees of dialogue, such as you find in role-playing games.</p>
<p>As I experiment with it, a couple of issues arise which tempt me to extend the original idea.</p>
<h2>Indirection</h2>
<p>It's the custom in Computer Science to give the protagonists names such as <em>Alice</em> and <em>Boris</em>.
Sometimes in the field of Security Engineering there's another character too, <em>Colin</em>, who is usually trying to interrupt and spoil everything.</p>
<p>I prefer to separate the names of the characters from the roles they play.
So I think of the <em>Head</em> and the <em>Hand</em> as being the initiating and the responding party respectively.</p>
<p>My characters <em>Alice</em> and <em>Boris</em> (and <em>Colin</em> too if necessary) play the roles of Head and Hand, but are not bound to them.
Some activities actually negotiate these roles on the fly, and so I find the extra level of indirection to be important.</p>
<p>This allows us to think of some very interesting variations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can Boris ask Colin for help?</li>
<li>Can Colin step in and take his place?</li>
<li>Does Alice trust Colin?</li>
<li>Will Boris subsequently owe Colin a favour?</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.</p>
<h2>Composition</h2>
<p>Imagine the dialogue around making a pot of tea. There are many actions to perform.
You've got to find the cups, fill the kettle, and that's before all the questions about <em>how</em> people prefer
their tea.</p>
<p>So the top-level action spawns others. Some of them may be performed concurrently, but many depend on the outcome of a
previous action.
Some can be tried again; with others it's the end of the whole process if they fail.</p>
<p>I'm starting to think there's a difference between an Action and an Activity. The word <em>Action</em> feels spontaneous and
bounded in time, whereas an <em>Activity</em> takes longer. Perhaps it's the repetition of an Action until it succeeds?</p>
<h1>Fruition of Action</h1>
<p>Here's my update to the original diagram. I call this variant <em>Fruition of Action</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="Fruition of Action" src="https://tundish.github.io/junkdlc/img/fruition.png" style="width:96%;margin:1rem"></p>
<p>I've given each state a name. The happy path for the action consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inception</li>
<li>Elaboration</li>
<li>Construction</li>
<li>Evaluation</li>
<li>Completion</li>
</ul>
<p>The Discussion state represents the negotiation between parties prior to Construction.
The action may terminate sub-optimally to states Withdrawn, Defaulted or Cancelled.</p>
<p>I renamed some of the transitions so they are specific to the role which
performs them. This disambiguates the negotiation phase between Elaboration and Discussion.
An <em>offer</em> comes from the Hand, and the Head makes the corresponding <em>clarification</em>.</p>
<p>The arrowheads are different in each case. The Head transitions have triangular points, whereas those
of the Hand are rounded and open.</p>
<p>Here is the full state table, including participle names for the transitions:</p>

<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Modelling social situations requires some thought. It's not about who's doing what.
The key is to understand the contracts woven by their Speech Acts.</p>
<h2>Commission of Action</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>ALICE (proposing):
Stick the kettle on, would you?</p>
<p>BORIS (offering):
Tea or Coffee?</p>
<p>ALICE (clarifying):
Tea please.</p>
<p>BORIS (promising):
Righto.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is very clear what's required here. Alice, the Head, wants tea and Boris as the Hand will make it.</p>
<p>Of course there's a chance Boris might be disinclined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALICE (proposing):
Stick the kettle on, would you?</p>
<p>BORIS (declining):
No time, sorry. I'm just about to leave for my train.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Alice has been known to change her mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALICE (proposing):
Stick the kettle on, would you?</p>
<p>BORIS (promising):
OK.</p>
<p>ALICE (cancelling):
Do you know what, I think I'll have a bath first. I'll be back down in half an hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Invitation to Action</h2>
<p>What if Alice goes down to the Kitchen and finds Boris there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALICE (proposing):
Tea?</p>
<p>BORIS (promising):
Sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alice (Head) has announced she's making tea. Boris (Hand) has promised if she does he'll drink a cup. They are in the Construction
state of that agreement.</p>
<p>Now another action is born:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALICE (proposing):
Can you get the mugs for me?</p>
<p>BORIS (offering):
Mugs or cups?</p>
<p>ALICE (clarifying):
My big blue mug.</p>
<p>BORIS (offering):
It's in the sink. I'll give it a rinse.</p>
<p>ALICE (confirming):
Thank you.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Misunderstandings and conflicts arise from time to time. As they do here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALICE (proposing):
Can you get the mugs for me?</p>
<p>BORIS (offering):
My phone's ringing, I'll get them in a second.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His words lack conviction. It's a weak offer which might equally be interpreted as disinclination.
Even if he means to make a promise, Boris might not be able to meet Alice's expectations for timeliness.
What happens next?</p>
<p>Would it change Boris' intentions if he spots the illocutionary nod from Alice?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALICE (confirming): .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How long will it be before we hear this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALICE (cancelling):
Oh forget it, I'll get them myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>When you start to use this system of writing, it doesn't take long for the terminology to become second nature.
I'm finding it a great way of annotating my dialogue.</p>
